<h1>SCRIBBLE SCRAMBLE</h1>

I've been working on this on the backburner for a few months now, and it is a multiplayer drawing game designed in Python with Pyglet and OpenGL. 
I myself designed both the front and back end with a distributed server architecture and custom data distribution functions along with graphics programming involving shaders and framebuffers. 
I plan to release this to Steam sometime within a year or two.
